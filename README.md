# MINIL Machine-Code Monitor, Improved

This is very nearly all based on David Johnson-Davies' excellent [original](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?NNJ) with some adaptations: 

- Meant to run on Arduino Nano instead of ATtiny85
- Ported to Arduino Keypad library use
- Ported to non-TinySPI 7-segment display (normal SPI)
- Added inline instruction set documentation
- Modified Enter button handling for board layout
- Added instruction delay to behave more like ATtiny85
- Added [0-7]9 register display instruction
- Added [0-7]F delay instruction
